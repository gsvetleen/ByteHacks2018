            MATERIALS AND TOOLS Available on Amazon: One 1″ x 8″ cedar board 8 feet long (you’ll have enough to make at least two) 1″ Forstner bit or hole saw Waterproof wood glue, such as Titebond III Bar clamps 1-1/4″ decking or galvanized screws 1/2″ galvanized pipe flange and short screws 1/2″ galvanized pipe Screwdriver
            DIRECTIONS 1. Begin by choosing a nice dry, straight 1″ × 8″ cedar board at the lumberyard or home center and cut it to the following sizes and multiples:
            Sides: Two pieces cut to 4″ x 3-1/2″ Floor: One piece cut to 5″ x 3-1/4″ Right roof: One piece cut to 4-3/4″ x 7″ Left roof: One piece cut to 5-1/2″ x 7″ Front and back: Two pieces cut to 5″ x 8″ Note: You should have seven cut pieces in total
            2. Cut the front and the back to create a “traditional” angled-roof house shape. Draw a line down the center and cut at 45° towards the sides to create a five-sided polygon. Then drill a 1″ in the front, about 2/3 of the way from the floor; the exact placement is up to you.
            3. Begin assembling by placing the floor on a flat surface, with the rough side facing up. Add the front and back and the sides, with the rough part facing in. Apply glue to all joined surfaces, clamp, and allow to dry.
            4. After the glue has cured, screw the pipe flange into the bottom using shorter screws. Attach the roof pieces with a butt joint and screw together at 90°. Center the roof on the house and use screws and pilot holes to attach the roof to the front and back only. This will allow the roof to be easily removed for cleaning.
            Welcome your new friends to your yard. If you’re interested in a smaller or bigger house, just scale this design up or down. If you are interested in taking it up a notch, you can find a how-to for the modern bird house design featured in the top photo at Curbly and another at Build by Kids.

            Level: Easy
            Size: Scarf measures 64" around, and is 7" wide (not including fringe). These measurements are easily adjustable. 
            
            Materials:
            •    N hook (9.00mm)
            •    Yarn needle
            •    Lion's Pride Woolspun (from Lion Brand), about 400 yards. The color in the photos is Taupe.               *About Lion's Pride Woolspun:               Weight: #5 Bulky                Fiber: 80% acrylic, 20% wool               Yardage: 100 g (3.5 oz) / 127 yd (116 m)
            •    4 button embellishments (mine are 1"), plus tools to attach buttons (needle, thread)
            Gauge: With N hook, a row of 7HDC = 3" in length.
            
            Abbreviations Used: CH (chain) SK (skip) SS (slip stitch) SC (single crochet) HDC (half double crochet) DC (double crochet) SC+DC (this just means to put a single crochet and a double crochet in the same stitch)
            Special Terminology: 3rd Loop - Some rows call for the stitches to be completed in the "3rd loop". When working in turned rows, and after completing a row of HDC, these loops will be visible just below the front loop. So instead of inserting your hook into the top loops, you'll only insert it into that 3rd loop. This will force the top loops to go to the front of your work, which is how we get the "ribbing" effect. Click here for tutorial.
            
            Notes: (1) This pattern is written in American Standard terms. (2) The buttons are just a decorative embellishment (non-functional).
            - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
            To begin: Using N Hook, and leaving a 12" tail, CH151.
            Row 1:  SC+DC in 3rd CH from hook. (SK next ST, SC+DC in next ST) across. (150)
            Row 2: CH1, turn. SK 1st ST, SC+DC in next ST. (SK next ST, SC+DC in next ST) across. (150)
            Row 3: CH1, turn. SK 1st ST, SC+DC in next ST. (SK next ST, SC+DC in next ST) across. (150)
            Row 4: CH1, turn. SK 1st ST. HDC in each of the next 148 STS. 2HDC in last ST. (150)
            Row 5: CH1, turn. Working in 3rd loops, SK 1st ST, SC+DC in next ST. (SK next ST, SC+DC in next ST) across. (150)
            Rows 6-16: Repeat Rows 2-5, in order, until you have 16 total rows (you will end with a repeat of Row 4). (150)
            Edging We are going to put an edging on only one end of the scarf (it isn't necessary anywhere else). So, with your hook in the same place you left off on Row 16, CH 1. SC into the same ST again to turn the corner to the short end of the scarf. SC evenly along the edge, putting 4SC in between each ribbing row. When you get to the end of the short edge, finish it off with a CH1 and a SL ST into the same ST as your last SC. Fasten off and weave in your ends.
            Fringe We need to cut approximately 75 pieces of yarn for the fringe. Find a sturdy, thin object in your home that measures somewhere between 8-10". I used my 9" cutting board and it worked perfectly! Here's how you make fringe (the numbers correspond to the photos below):
            1. Wrap the yarn around the cutting board about 40 times (this will give us a little wiggle room). Wrap it snug, but don't wrap it crazy-tight. Try to be consistent. 2. Take a good pair of scissors and carefully cut the yarn right down the center of the pile. 3. You now have a pile of yarn approximately 18" long. Very carefully, fold it in half and cut at the halfway point again. You should now have about 80 strands of yarn. 4. Start at one end of the scarf, on the side where you began the pattern (the CH151 side). Using a crochet hook and one strand of yarn, find the first stitch. Fold the yarn in half and use the hook to pull it halfway through the space created by that first stitch. The two ends of the strand should be poking out the front of the entry point. 5. Remove your hook and insert the two ends of the strand through the loop. 6. Pull tight. 7. Continue down the scarf, adding fringe to every other stitch. This will be easy to spot, because when you did your SC+DCs, they created little spaces. Use the photo for a visual.
            
            Button Embellishments Use your needle and thread to attach the 4 buttons to the front of the short end of the scarf (the one that has the edging!).
            Seaming To make this an infinity scarf, we're going to attach the ends together. Instead of doing a normal seam (where the first row is joined to the last row), we are going to overlap the edge with the buttons over the other end by about 1-2". This will give the illusion that the buttons are holding it closed. You can use a needle and thread to sew along the edge. (I sewed the bottom layer to the underside of the top layer so that it didn't disrupt the look of the top piece, because I'm not very good at sewing.) You could also use a sturdy fabric glue, but be sure it's machine-washable!

            Repeat rows 2 through 5 until piece measures approximately 8 inches across lower edge. End with row 2 or 4.
            Change to contrasting color yarn and work 2 rows to form first stripe. Repeat until you have 3 stripes.
            Continue working rows 2 through 5 in main color until piece measures approximately 20 to 21 inches. End with row 4.
            Sl st or sew last row to first row, being careful to maintain the ribbed pattern. Hold cap with the working yarn on the right and the last row on top. Fold the cap, bringing the first and last rows together with the first row in front. (Note: the cap is wrong side out.) Sl st or sew through the unused loops of the starting chain 50 and the back loop of the stitches of the last row.
            Fasten off yarn leaving approximately an 8 inch tail. Using a yarn needle, thread the yarn tail through the sc at the top of the cap. Pull yarn to close the opening. Fasten securely.
            Weave in all yarn ends, turn cap right side out and turn up brim.
